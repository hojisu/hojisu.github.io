출력하는 분석 방법이다. \n입력데이터와 출력데이터\n입력데이터(input data)는 분석의 기반이 되는 데이터로 보통 알파벳 X로 표기한다. 선형회귀에서는 독립변수(indepentent variable), 분류에서는 특징(feature), 머신러닝에서는 설명변수(explanatory variable) 등의 용어를 쓰기도 한다.\n출력데이터(output data)는 추정하거나 예측하고자 하는 목적 데이터로 보통 알파벳 Y로 표기. 선형회귀에서는 종속변수(dependent variable), 종속변수가 뒤에서 설명할 카테고리값이면 라벨(label) 또는 클래스(class) 라고 하기도 한다.\n규칙기반 방법과 학습기반 방법\n규칙기반(rule-based)는 어떤 입력이 들어오면 어떤 출력이 나오는지를 결정하는 규칙이나 알고리즘을 사람이 미리 만들어 놓는 방법이다.\n학습기반(traing-based), 데이터기반(data-based)은 대량의 데이터를 컴퓨터에 보여줌으로써 스스로 규칙을 만들게 하는 방법이다. \n지도학습\n학습용 데이터 집합(training data set)은 입력값과 목푯값(정답)을 쌍으로 가지는 표본 데이터의 집합이다. 학습시키고자 하는 예측 시스템이 최종적으로 동작하기를 바라는 모습을 표현한 데이터 집합이라고 볼 수 있다.\n지도학습(supervised learning)은 출력 데이터(목표)값을 붙이는 작업은 당연히 사람이 수동으로 해야 한다. 그래서 이러한 방법이다.\n목푯값(target)은 학습용 데이터 집합에 붙어있는 출력 데이터이다.\n레이블링(labelling)은 입력데이터만 있고 이에 대응하는 목푯값이 없다면 각 입력데이터에 대해 사람이 원하는 목표값을 붙여주는 작업이다.\n이미지넷\n이미지넷(ImageNet)은 페이페이 리(Fei-Fei Li) 교수가 이끄는 인공지능 팀이 만들어 2009년에 공개한 학습용 데이터셋이다.\n전처리와 인코딩\n문서나 이미지와 같은 현실의 데이터를 컴퓨터가 처리할 수 있는 숫자데이터로 바꾸는 과정이다.\n전처리(preprocessing)는 전체 입력 정보 중 실제로 출력 데이터의 결정에 영향을 미칠만한 핵심 정보를 선택하거나 복수의 입력 데이터를 조합하여 새로운 입력 데이터를 만드는 것도 전처리의 중요한 역할이다. \n인코딩(encoding)\n입력차원\n입력차원(input dimension)은 입력의 개수, 즉 숫자 벡터의 크기이다.\nBOW(Bag of Words)은 문서 데이터를 고정된 크기의 숫자 벡터로 바꾸는 방법으로 오로지 특정한 단어가 문서에 몇 번 나왔는지만 세어 그 빈도를 벡터로 표시하는 방법이다.\n카테고리값\n카테고리(category)값 또는 범주형 값은 기호로 표시된 비연속적데이터이다.  두 개의 데이터가 있을 때 이들의 크기나 가치, 혹은 순서를 비교할 수 있는가 없는가이다.\n클래스(class)는 카테고리값은 가질 수 있는 경우의 수이다.\n회귀분석과 분류\n회귀분석(regression analysis)은 출력하고자 하는 값이 숫자인 경우이다.\n분류(classfication)는 출력하고자 하는 값이 카테고리값인 경우이다.\n비지도학습\n비지도학습(unsupervised learning)은 입력/출력이 구분되지 않는 단순한 \"데이터들의 관계\"에서 특정한 규칙을 찾아내는 것, 입력/출력 데이터를 구분짓지 않고 단순히 데이터를 입력하면 이 데이터들간의 규칙을 찾아내거나 미리 지정한 규칙(모형)에 맞는 데이터인지를 구분해 낸다.\n클러스터링\n클러스터링(clustering)은 데이터들을 유사한 데이터까지 같은 그룹으로 모으는 방법이다.\n"},"posts/computerscience/":{"url":"posts/computerscience/","title":"Computer Science","keywords":"","body":"Computer Science\n"}}}
