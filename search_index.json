A는 고정된 것이고, 두 개의 미지수가 x와 람다(lambda)이다. 결국 식 (2)를 만족시키는 벡터 x들이 고유벡터(eigenvector)가 된다. 곱해지는 모든 벡터 x들을 변화시키지만, 변하는 와중에 변하지 않는 성분이 존재하기 마련이고, 선형시스템 A의 그 변하지 않는 성분, 혹은 속성이 고유값(eigenvalues)과 고유벡터(eigenvectors)라는 형태로 표현된 것이다. \n임의의 실수 행렬 𝑋에 대해 𝑋^𝑇𝑋(정방이면서 대칭행렬)인 정방행렬을 공분산행렬(covariance matrix)이라고 한다. \n\n\n고윳값과 고유벡터\n정방 행렬 𝐴에 대해 다음 식을 만족하는 영벡터가 아닌 벡터 𝑣, 실수 𝜆를 찾을 수 있다고 가정하자.\n\nAv = \\lambda v\n\n이 식은 다음 처럼 쓸수도 있다.\n\nAv - \\lambda v = (A - \\lambda I) v = 0\n\n위 식을 만족하는 실수 𝜆를 고윳값(eigenvalue), 벡터 𝑣 를 고유벡터(eigenvector)라고 한다.\n어떤 벡터를 행렬에 곱한 결과로 나타난 벡터가 원래의 벡터와 같은 방향을 향하고 있다면 이를 고유벡터라고 한다. 다만 크기나 방향은 원래의 벡터와 달라질 수가 있는데 달라진 크기를 나타내는 비율을 고윳값이라고 부른다.\n고윳값과 고유벡터를 찾는 작업을 고유분해(eigen-decomposition) 또는 고윳값 분해(eigenvalue decomposition)라고 한다.\n예시)\n\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n다음 스칼라 값(𝜆)과 벡터(𝑣)는 각각 고윳값, 고유벡터가 된다.\n\n\\lambda = -1,\\;\\; v=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\nAv = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n(-1)\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\lambda v\n\n어떤 벡터 𝑣가 고유벡터가 되면 이 벡터에 실수를 곱한 벡터 𝑐𝑣, 즉 𝑣와 방향이 같은 벡터는 모두 고유벡터가 된다. 예를 들어 행렬 𝐴에 대해 다음 벡터는 모두 고유벡터이다.\n\nv=\nc\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\nAv = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\left(\nc\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  \\\\\n1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\right)\n=\nc\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n(-1)c\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\lambda (cv)\n\n보통 고유벡터를 표시할 때는 길이가 1인 단위벡터가 되도록 다음처럼 정규화(normalization)를 한다.\n\n\\dfrac{v}{\\|v\\|}\n\n위 행렬 𝐴의 고유값-고유벡터는 보통 다음처럼 나타내는 경우가 많다.\n\n\\lambda = -1\n\n\nv=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}  \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\approx\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.7071 \\\\\n0.7071\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n특성방정식\n행렬만 주어졌을 때 고윳값-고유벡터 구하는 방법\n행렬 𝐴의 고유값은 𝐴−𝜆𝐼의 행렬식이 0이 되도록 하는 특성방정식(characteristic equation)의 해를 구하면 된다.\n\n\\det \\left( A - \\lambda I \\right) = 0\n\n이 조건은 행렬 𝐴−𝜆𝐼가 역행렬이 존재하지 않는다는 뜻이다. 만약 𝐴−𝜆𝐼의 역행렬이 존재한다면 아래의 식에서 고윳값 조건을 만족하는 벡터가 항상 영벡터가 되기 때문이다.\n\nAv - \\lambda v = (A - \\lambda I) v = 0  \n\n\n(A - \\lambda I)^{-1}(A - \\lambda I)v = 0 \\;\\; \\rightarrow \\;\\; v = 0\n\n예시 1) 해가 1개(사실은 중근으로 해가 2개) -> 고윳값은 -1(중근으로 -1, -1)\n\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\det \\left( A - \\lambda I \\right) \n&=&\n\\det \n\\left(\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n-\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\right) \n\\\\\n&=&\n\\det \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 - \\lambda & -2 \\\\\n2 & -3 -\\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n&=& (1 - \\lambda)(-3 -\\lambda) + 4 \\\\\n&=& \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 1 = 0\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n인수분해를 하여 이차방정식인 특성방정식을 풀면\n\n\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda + 1 = (\\lambda + 1)^2 = 0\n\n에서 고윳값은 -1이다.

PCA에서는 잠재변수와 측정 데이터가 선형적인 관계로 연결되어 있다고 가정한다. 즉, 𝑖번째 표본의 측정 데이터 벡터 𝑥_𝑖의 각 원소를 선형조합하면 그 뒤에 숨은 𝑖번째 표본의 잠재변수 u_i의 값을 계산할 수 있다고 가정한다. 이를 수식으로 나타내면 다음과 같다. 이 식에서 𝑤는 측정 데이터 벡터의 각 원소를 조합할 가중치 벡터이다.\n\n\n\nu_i = w^Tx_i\n\n\n차원축소와 투영\n차원축소문제는 다차원 벡터를 더 낮은 차원의 벡터공간에 투영하는 문제로 생각하여 풀 수 있다. 즉, 특이분해에서 살펴본 로우-랭크 근사(low-rank approximation) 문제가 된다. 이 문제는 다음과 같이 서술할 수 있다.\n𝑁 개의  𝑀 차원  데이터 벡터  𝑥_1,𝑥_2,⋯,𝑥_𝑁를 정규직교인  기저벡터  𝑤_1,𝑤_2,⋯,𝑤_𝐾 로 이루어진  𝐾 차원 벡터공간으로 투영하여 가장 비슷한  𝑁 개의  𝐾 차원 벡터  a^{\\Vert w}_1 ,a^{\\Vert w}_2 ,⋯,a^{\\Vert w}_N 를 만들기 위한 정규직교 기저벡터  𝑤_1,𝑤_2,⋯,𝑤_𝐾 를 찾는다.\n근사 성능을 높이기 위해 직선이 원점을 지나야한다는 제한조건을 없애야 한다. 따라서 문제는 다음과 같이 바뀐다\n𝑁개의 𝑀차원 데이터 벡터 𝑥_1,𝑥_2,⋯,𝑥_𝑁에 대해 어떤 상수 벡터  𝑥_0를 뺀 데이터 벡터 𝑥_1−𝑥_0,𝑥_2−𝑥_0,⋯,𝑥_𝑁−𝑥_0를 정규직교인 기저벡터 𝑤_1,𝑤_2,⋯,𝑤_𝐾로 이루어진 𝐾차원 벡터공간으로 투영하여 가장 비슷한 𝑁개의 𝐾차원 벡터 a^{\\Vert w}_1 ,a^{\\Vert w}_2 ,⋯,a^{\\Vert w}_N 를 만들기 위한 정규직교 기저벡터 𝑤_1,𝑤_2,⋯,𝑤_𝐾와 상수 벡터 𝑥_0를 찾는다.\n𝑁개의 데이터를 1차원 직선에 투영하는 문제라고 하면 원점을 지나는 직선을 찾는게 아니라 원점이 아닌 어떤 점 𝑥0을 지나는 직선을 찾는 문제로 바꾼 것이다.\n이 문제의 답은 다음과 같다. \n𝑥_0 는 데이터 벡터 𝑥_1,𝑥_2,⋯,𝑥_𝑁 의 평균벡터이고 𝑤_1,𝑤_2,⋯,𝑤_𝐾 는 가장 큰  𝐾 개의 특잇값에대응하는  오른쪽 특이벡터  𝑣_1,𝑣_2,⋯,𝑣_𝐾 이다.\nPCA의 수학적 설명\n𝐾 차원의 데이터 𝑥가 𝑁개 있으면 이 데이터는 특징 행렬 X \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N\\times K}로 나타낼 수 있다. 이 데이터를 가능한한 쓸모있는 정보를 유지하면서 더 적은 차원인 𝑀(𝑀데이터가 원점을 중심으로 존재하는 경우에는 벡터에 변환행렬을 곱하는 연산으로 투영 벡터를 계산할 수 있다. 다음처럼 데이터 𝑥에 변환행렬 W \\in \\mathbf{R}^{M \\times K}을 곱해서 새로운 데이터 \\hat{x}_i를 구하는 연산을 생각하자.\n\n\\hat{x}_i = W x_i\n\n\nx \\in \\mathbf{R}^K,\\; W \\in \\mathbf{R}^{M \\times K},\\; \\hat{x} \\in \\mathbf{R}^M\n\n모든 데이터 𝑥𝑖(𝑖=1,⋯,𝑁)에 대해 이러한 변환을 할 경우에는 행렬식으로 바꿀 수 있다.\n\n\\hat{X} = XW^{T}\n\n\nX \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N \\times K},\\; \\hat{X} \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N \\times M}, W^T \\in \\mathbf{R}^{K \\times M}\n\n이 식에서 행렬 𝑋는 벡터 x_i (i=1, \\cdots, N)를 행으로 가지는 행렬이고 행렬 𝑋̂ 는 벡터 \\hat{x}_i (i=1, \\cdots, N)를 행으로 가지는 행렬이다.\nPCA의 목표는 변환 결과인 차원축소 벡터 \\hat{x}_i정보가 원래의 벡터 𝑥_𝑖가 가졌던 정보와 가장 유사하게 되는 변환행렬 𝑊 값을 찾는 것이다.\n그러나 \\hat{x}_i는 𝑀(𝑥_𝑖와 차원이 다르기 때문에 직접 두 벡터의 유사도를 비교할 수 없다. 따라서 \\hat x_i를 도로 𝐾차원 벡터로 선형 변형하는 역변환행렬 U \\in \\mathbf{R}^{K \\times M}도 같이 찾아야 한다. 그러면 원래의 데이터 벡터 𝑥를 더 낮은 차원의 데이터 𝑥̂ =𝑊𝑥으로 변환했다가 다시 원래의 차원으로 되돌릴 수 있다. 도로 𝐾차원으로 변환된 벡터를 \\hat{\\hat{x}}라고 하자.\n\n\\hat{\\hat{x}} = U \\hat{x}\n\n\n\\hat{x} \\in \\mathbf{R}^M,\\; U \\in \\mathbf{R}^{K \\times M},\\; \\hat{\\hat{x}} \\in \\mathbf{R}^K\n\n물론 이렇게 변환과 역변환을 통해 원래의 차원으로 되돌린 벡터 𝑈𝑥̂ 은 원래의 벡터 𝑥와 비슷할 뿐 정확히 같지는 않다. 다만 이 값을 다시 한번 차원 축소 변환하면 도로 𝑥̂ 가 된다. 즉\n\nW \\hat{\\hat{x}} = W U \\hat{x} = \\hat{x}\n\n따라서 𝑊와 𝑈는 다음 관계가 있다.\n\nWU = I\n\n역변환행렬 𝑈을 알고 있다고 가정하고 역변환을 했을 때 원래 벡터 𝑥와 가장 비슷해지는 차원축소 벡터 𝑥̂ 를 다음과 같이 최적화를 이용하여 찾는다.\n\n\\arg\\min_{\\hat{x}} || x - U \\hat{x} ||^2\n\n증명 생략 \n\nWW^{T} = I\n\n남은 문제는 최적의 변환 행렬 𝑊을 찾는 것이다. 이 경우의 최적화 문제는 다음과 같이 된다.\n\n\\arg\\min_{W} \\sum_{i=1}^N || x_i - W^{T} W x_i ||^2\n\n모든 데이터에 대해 적용하면 목적함수는 다음처럼 바뀐다.\n\n\\arg\\min_{W} || X - X W^{T} W ||^2\n\n랭크-𝐾 근사문제이므로 W는 가장 큰 𝐾 개의 특잇값에 대응하는 오른쪽 특이벡터로 만들어진 행렬이다.\n주성분 추출 방법\n\n위 그래프에서 가장 폭 넓게 데이터를 표현할 수 있는 축은 x축, y축도 아닌 대각선으로 그려진 빨간선일 것이다. 가장 폭이 넓다는 것은 통계량으로 표현하자면 분산이 가장 크게 되는 축이라고 말할 수 있다.

함수이다.\n\n\n함수\n함수(function)는 입력 값을 출력 값으로 바꾸어 출력하는 관계(relationship)를 말한다.  맵(map), 매핑(mapping), 사전(dictionary)라는 용어로 사용하기도 한다. 함수에서 입력 변수가 가질 수 있는 값의 집합을 정의역(domain)이고, 출력 변수가 가질 수 있는 값의 집합을 공역(range)이라고 한다. 서로 관계를 가지며 맺어지는 모든 숫자의 쌍은 함수라고 생각 할 수 있다.\n표를 사용한 함수 구현\n정의역이 유한개의 원소로만 이루어져 있다면 함수는 일종의 표(lookup table)가 된다. 정의역이 유한개여서 표로 나타낼 수 있는 함수는 파이썬의 딕셔너리(dictionary) 로 구현할 수 있다.\n# 함수 정의\nf = {\n    1: 2,\n    2: 4,\n    3: 6,\n    4: 8,\n    5: 10,\n}\n\n변수\n정의역이 무한개의 원소로 이루어졌다면 더이상 표나 딕셔너리를 사용해서 함수를 구현 할 수 없다. 이 때는 변수와 수식을 사용하여 입력과 출력간의 관계를 정의해야 한다. 변수(variable) 란 어떤 숫자를 대표하는 기호이다. 함수에서 입력 값이나 출력 값을 기호 즉 변수로 나타내기도 한다. \n입력 값을 대표하는 변수를 입력 변수(input variable) 라 하고 출력 값을 대표하는 변수를 출력 변수(ounput variable) 라고 한다. \n변수는 보통 x, y, z 등의 알파벳 소문자로 표시한다. 함수에서 기호를 사용하는 이유는 입력 값과 출력 값의 관계를 수식으로 표한 하기 위해서 이다.\n​                                       y = 2x  \n함수를 여러개 사용할 때는  𝑓, 𝑔, ℎ 와 같이 알파벳 소문자로 이름을 붙여 구별한다. 함수를 표기할 때는 다음처럼 입력 변수를 붙여서 𝑓(𝑥)라고 표기한다. 이 기호는 \"f of x\" 라고 읽는다.파이썬의 함수 기능은 수학 함수의 개념을 구현한 것으로 볼 수 있다.\ndef f(x):\n    return 2 * x\n\n\nx = 10\ny = f(x)\n\nprint(\"f({}) = {}\".format(x, y))\n\nf(10)\n\n연속\n함수의 값이 중간에 갑자기 변하는 것을 불연속(discontinous)이라고 하고 그렇지 않으면 연속(continous)이라고 한다.\n부호 함수(sign function) 는 입력이 양수이면 1, 음수이면 -1, 0이면 0을 출력하는 불연속 함수이다.\n\n\\text{sgn}(x) =\\begin{cases} 1, & x > 0, \\\\ 0, & x = 0, \\\\ -1, & x \n단위계단함수(Heaviside step function)도 x = 0에서 불연속인 함수이다.\n\nH(x) =\\begin{cases} 1, & x \\ge 0, \\\\ 0, & x \n지시함수(indicator function)는  함수 이름에 아래 첨자로 미리 지정된 값이 들어오면 출력이 1이 되고 아니면 출력이 0이 된다.지시함수는 데이터 중에서 특정한 데이터만 선택하여 갯수를 세는데 사용된다.

파악하기 위해 그래프(graph) 또는 플롯(plot)를 사용하기도 한다. 파이썬에서는 matplotlib의 라인 플롯을 사용하여 그래프를 만들 수 있다. 단점은 matplotlib에서는 그래프를 작성할 영역을 작은 구간으로 나눈 독립 변수값 벡터 𝑥 를 생성하고 이 위치에 대한 함수값 벡터 𝑦를 하나하나 계산하여 이렇게 만들어진 점을 직선으로 연결하는 방식으로 플롯을 그린다. 따라서 구간의 간격이 너무 크면 그래프가 부정확해지고 구간의 간격이 너무 작으면 계산 시간이 증가하며 메모리 등의 리소스가 낭비된다.\n역함수의 그래프\n역함수의 그래프는 원래의 함수에서 𝑥축과 𝑦축과 바뀐 것이므로 𝑦=𝑥가 나타내는 직선(원점을 통과하는 기울기 1인 직선)을 대칭축으로 대칭인 함수의 그래프와 같다.\n데이터

c_n x^n\n  \n\n최대/최소 함수\n최대함수는 두 개의 인수 중에서 큰 값을 출력하는 함수이다.  max(x, y)\n입력 값이 양수이면 그대로 출력하고 음수일 때는 0으로 만들어 줄 때 주로 사용한다. max(x, 0) 인공신경망에서는 이 함수를 ReLU(Rectified Linear Unit) 이라고 부른다.\n\n최소함수는 두 개의 인수 중 작은 값을 출력하는 함수이다. min(x,y)\n지수함수\n정해진 어떤 값을 입력 값으로 거듭제곱하여 출력을 구하는 함수 y = a^x 에서 거듭 제곱을 할 때 아래에 있는 수를 밑(base)라고 한다.  밑을 오일러 수 e(약 2.718)로 하여 거듭제곱을 하는 함수를 지수 함수(exponential funtion) 라고 한다. y = e^x \n지수

    \\exp(-x) 에서 - 를 곱해서 부호를 바꿔준다. 단조증가함수 이다. x 의 값이 증가하던 감소하던 무관하게 f(x) 는 0과 1사이의 값을 갖는 값이 된다. \n\n\\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}\n\n\n로지스틱 함수의 역함수는 로짓 함수(Logit function)이다. f(x) = log(\\dfrac{x}{1 +

x_2)} = \\log{x_1} + \\log{x_2}\n\n\n\\log{\\left(\\prod_i x_i\\right)} = \\sum_i \\left(\\log{x_i}\\right)\n\n위 식에서 x_1 = x_2 = … = x 라면 \\log x^n = n \\log x 이다. \n로그함수의 성질 2. 어떤 함수에 로그를 적용해도 함수의 최고점, 최저점의 위치는 변하지 않는다.\n만약 양수값만을 가지는 함수가 있을 대 이 함수에 다시 로그함수를 적용하면 높낮이는 바뀌지만 \n최고점이나 최저점의 위치는 바뀌지 않는다. 따라서 최적화를 할 때 원래의 함수가 아니라 로그를 취한 함수에 대해 최적화를 실시하는 경우가 많다.\n\n로그 함수의 성질 3: 로그 함수는 0부터 1사이의 작은 값을 확대시켜 보여준다.\n로그 함수는 0부터 1사이의 구간을 음의 무한대부터 0까지로 확장시켜주기 때문에 확률값처럼 0과 1사이에 있는 작은 값을 더 확실하게 비교할 수 있도록 한다.\n\n\n소프트플러스(softplus) 함수는 지수 함수와 로그 함수를 결합하여 만든 함수로 0을 인수로 가지는 최대함수와 비슷하지만 x = 0 근처에서 값이 부드럽게 변한다는 장점이 있다. \n\n\\zeta(x) = \\log( 1 + \\exp(x))\n\n\n다변수함수\n다변수함수(multivariate function) : 복수의 입력 변수를 가지는 함수\nz = f(x, y) 는 f 가 2개의 입력 변수 x, y 를 받아서 변수 z 를 출력하는 다변수함수라는 뜻이다.\n2차원 함수는 평면상의 지형과 같기 때문에 3차원 서피스 플롯(surface plot), 컨투어 플롯(contour plot)으로 나타낼 수 있다. \n\n\n분리가능 다변수 함수\n다변수함수 중에는 단변수함수의 곱으로 표현 가능한 다변수함수도 있다.\n​                        f(x, y) =f_1(x)f_2(y)\n위의 다변수함수를 분리가능 다변수함수(separable multivariate function)이라고 하며 추후 확률변수에서 중요한 연락을 한다. 2차원 함수는 3차원 공간상의 지형에 비유할 수 있다. 2차원 함수를 x = x_0 또는 y = y_0 로 고정을 하면 1차원 단변수함수가 된다. 이 단변수함수의 모양은 3차원 공간상의 지형을 케이크 자르듯이 나눌 때 생기는 단면의 모양과 같다. \n분리가능 다변수함수는 단면의 모양이 모두 같은 함수를 높이만 다르게 조절한 것이다. \nx = x_0 로 고정하면 단면함수는 g(x_0, y) = g(x_0)g(y) = k_0g(y) 이르모 x_0 의 값과 상관없이 g(y) 의 높이만 조절한 모양이 된다.\n아래의 그래프는 𝑦=0,0.1,0.2,0.3 로 고정하였을 때 생기는 단면의 모양을 나타낸 것이다.\n\n다변수 다출력 함수\n어떤 함수는 입력 변수 뿐 아니라 출력 변수도 여러개 일 수 있다. 이 경우에는 출력을 벡터나 행렬로 나타낼 수 있다.\n예) 소프트맥스(softmax) 함수는 다차원 벡터를 입력받아 다차원 벡터를 출력한다. \n다음은 3차원 소프트맥스 함수이다.\n\ny =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\ y_2

숫자를 가진다. 선형 예측 모형에서는 입력 데이터에 대한 가중치(weight)가 모수가 된다. 모수를 어떤 숫자로 정하느냐에 따라 예측 모형의 성능이 달라진다. 모수를 함수의 입력이라고 한다면 성능은 함수의 출력이 된다.\n성능함수(performance function), 목적함수(objective function) 는 모수를 입력받아 모형의 성능을 출력하는 함수이다.  x 데이터를 받아 y 데이터를 출력하는 예측함수와는 다른 함수이다.  성능함수나 목적함수의 값은 클수록 좋다.\n손실함수(loss function), 비용함수(cost function) 는 모수를 입력받아 오차 혹은 오류의 크기를 출력하는 함수를 가장 작게 하는 것이다. \n\n최적화\n최적화(optimization)는 함수의 값이 가장 커지거나 가장 작아지게 하는 입력변수의 값을 찾아내는 것이다. \n데이터 분석에서 미분이 필요한 이유\n데이터 분석에서 우리가 최종적으로 원하는 것은 결국 최적화(optimization) 작업이다.  그런데 수치적 최적화는 미분(differentiation)없이는 불가능하다. 이것이 데이터 분석에서 미분이 필요한 이유이다.  딥러닝용 라이브러리인 theano, tensorflow 등에서 파이썬이 자동으로 심볼릭 미분 연산 한다.\n기울기\n우리는 함수에 들어가는 입력이 달라졌을 때 출력이 어떻게 변하는지를 알아야 한다. 이 정보를 기울기(slope) 혹은 민감도(secsitivity) 라고 한다. 예로 입력변수의 값이 𝑥에서 𝑥_2로 달라졌다고 가정하자. 출력변수는 𝑓(𝑥)이라는 값에서

기울기(slope)를 출력한다. 도함수는 원래 함수에 프라임(prime) 기호(')를 붙이거나 원래 함수의 앞에 \\dfrac{d}{dx}를 붙여서 표시한다. 분수처럼 표기하기도 하는데 분모의 위치에는 미분하고자 하는 변수가 오고 분자의 위치에는 미분하는 함수 자체의 기호나 혹은 함수 계산의 결과로 얻어지는 출력 변수를 넣는다. 예를 들어 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)라는 함수를 미분하여 구한 도함수는 다음과 같이 여러가지 방법으로 표기할 수 있다. 도함수의 표기는 분수와 비슷하지만 분수의 기호만 빌려온 것일 뿐 분수가 아니라는 점에 주의한다.\n\nf' = \\dfrac{d}{dx}(f) = \\dfrac{d}{dx}f = \\dfrac{df}{dx}  = \\dfrac{d}{dx}(y) = \\dfrac{d}{dx}y =

개 이상의 독립변수를 가지는 다변수 함수인 경우에는 미분 즉, 기울기는 하나의 변수에 대해서만 구할 수 있다. 이를 편미분(partial differentiation) 이라고 한다. \n\nf_x(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\\nf_y(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\n\n편미분을 하는 방법은 변수가 하나인 함수의 미분과 같다. 어떤 하나의 독립 변수에 대해 미분할 때는 다른 독립변수를 상수로 생각하면 된다.\n편미분의 예\n\nf(x,y) = x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 \\\\\nf_x(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + 4y \\\\\nf_y(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 4x + 8y\n\n다변수 함수의 연쇄법칙\n다변수 함수의 미분을 구할 때도 함수가 연결되어 있으면 연쇄법칙이 적용된다. 예를 들어 변수 𝑥를 입력으로 가지는 함수가 𝑓_1,𝑓_2,…,𝑓_𝑁과 같이 𝑁개가 있고 각각의 출력을 𝑦_1,𝑦_2,…,𝑦_𝑁이라고 하자.\n\n\\begin{align}\ny_1 &= f_1(x) \\\\\ny_2 &= f_2(x) \\\\\n & \\vdots \\\\\ny_N &= f_N(x) \n\\end{align}\n\n그리고 이 𝑦_1,𝑦_2,…,𝑦_𝑁값에 의존하는 다른 함수 𝑔가 있다고 하자. 𝑔의 출력은 𝑧라고 한다.\n\nz = g(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_N)\n\n이 때 변수 x 값의 변화에 따른 z 값의 변화는 다음처럼 계산한다\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{dz}{dx} \n&= \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_1}\\dfrac{dy_1}{dx} + \n   \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_2}\\dfrac{dy_2}{dx} + \\cdots\n + \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_N}\\dfrac{dy_N}{dx}   \n\\end{align}\n\n이번에는 함수 f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N 가 x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_M 을 입력으로 가지는 다변수 함수라고 하자. \n\n\\begin{align}\ny_1 &= f_1(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_M) \\\\\ny_2 &= f_2(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_M) \\\\\n & \\vdots \\\\\ny_N &= f_N(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_M) \n\\end{align}\n\n이 때의 변수 x_1 값의 변화에 따른 z 값의 변화도 마찬가지로 계산할 수 있다.\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial x_1} \n&= \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_1}\\dfrac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_1} + \n   \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_2}\\dfrac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_1} + \\cdots\n + \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y_N}\\dfrac{\\partial y_N}{\\partial x_1}   \n\\end{align}\n\n2차 편미분\n편미분에 대해서도 2차 도함수를 정의할 수 있다. 편미분의 2차 도함수를 구할 때는 각각의 미분에 쓰이는 독립 변수를 자유롭게 선택할 수 있다.\n첫번째 미분과 두번째 미분에서 모두 x 에 대해 미분하여 다음과 같이 표기한다.\n\nf_{xx}(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n\n첫번째 미분과 두번째 미분에서 모두 𝑦에 대해 미분하면 다음과 같이 표기한다.\n\nf_{yy}(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 8\n\n첫번째 미분에서는 𝑥에 대해 미분하고 두번째 미분에서는 𝑦에 대해 미분하면 다음과 같이 표기한다.\n\nf_{xy}(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 4\n\n첫번째 미분에서는 𝑦에 대해 미분하고 두번째 미분에서는 𝑥에 대해 미분하면 다음과 같이 표기한다.\n\nf_{yx}(x,y) = \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 4\n\n위 결과에서 𝑥로 먼저 미분하고 나중에 𝑦로 미분한 2차 도함수 𝑓𝑥𝑦는 𝑦로 먼저 미분하고 나중에 𝑥로 미분한 2차 도함수 𝑓𝑦𝑥와 같다. 만약 함수가 연속이고 미분가능하면 미분의 순서는 상관없다. 이를 슈와르츠 정리(Schwarz's theorem)라고 한다.\n테일러 전개\n함수의 기울기(1차 미분값)를 알고 있다면 함수의 모양을 다음처럼 근사화할 수 있다.  이를 테일러 전개(Talor expansion)라고 한다. 𝑥_0는 함수값과 기울기를 구하는 𝑥 위치이며 사용자가 마음대로 설정할 수 있다.\n(x_0, f(x_0))을 지나는 직선 \n\nf(x) 는 곡선이고 변수 이다.\n\nf(x_0)은 직선이고 숫자이다.\n\\dfrac{df(x_0)}{dx} 는 x_0 에서의 기울기이고 숫이다.\nx - x_0 에서 x 는 문자이다. \n위의 내용을 합치면 직선의 방정식이다 \n예) 2 + 3(x - 1) : (1, 2)를 지나는 직선이다. \n\nf(x)

않지만 심볼릭 변수는 아무런 숫자도 대입이 되어 있지 않다. 따라서 𝑥2의 미분 연산을 수행하기 위해서는 우선 SymPy의 symbols 명령을 사용하여 𝑥x라는 기호가 단순한 숫자나 벡터 변수가 아닌 심볼(symbol)임을 알려주어야 한다. 이렇게 정의된 심볼 변수는 Symbol 클래스 자료형이 된다.\nx =

한다.\nx, mu, sigma = sympy.symbols('x mu sigma')\nf = sympy.exp((x - mu) ** 2 / sigma ** 2)\nf\n\nsympy.diff(f, x)\nsympy.simplify(sympy.diff(f, x))\n\n이차 도함수는 다음처럼 구한다.\nsympy.diff(f, x,

함수를 미분하여 나온 결과인 도함수라고 가정하고 이 도함수 𝑓(𝑥)에 대한 미분되기 전의 원래의 함수를 찾는 과정(integration), 또는 그 결과(integral)를 말한다.\n부정적분으로 찾은 원래의 함수를 표기할 때는 도함수를 대문자화(capitalization)하여 표기할 때도 있지만 다음처럼 ∫기호(integral이라고 읽는다.)로 나타내는 것이 일반적이다. 여기에서 도함수가 𝑓(𝑥)이므로 미분하기 전의 함수를 𝐹(𝑥) 또는 ∫𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥로 쓴다. 𝑑𝑥는 𝑥라는 변수로 적분했다는 것을 나타내는 기호로 편미분에 대응하는 적분을 표기할 때 필요하다\n\n\\dfrac{dF(x)}{dx} = f(x) \\;\\;\\leftrightarrow\\;\\; F(x) = \\int_{}^{} f(x) dx + C\n\nc는 상수항을 뜻한다. 상수항은 미분하면 0이 되므로 부정적분은 무한 개의 해가 있다. c는 너무 당연하므로 생략하고 쓰는 경우도 있다.\n편미분의 부정적분\n편미분을 한 도함수에서 원래의 함수를 찾을 수도 있다. 다음 식은 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)가 원래의 함수를 어떻게 미분했는지에 따라 원래의 함수를 표기하는 방법이 달라진다는 것을 나타낸다.\n만약 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)가 함수 𝐹_1(𝑥,𝑦)를 𝑥로 편미분한 함수였다면 이 함수를 찾는 식은 다음과 같다.\n\n\\dfrac{\\partial F_1(x, y)}{\\partial x} = f(x, y) \\; \\leftrightarrow \\; F_1(x, y) = \\int_{}^{} f(x, y) dx + C(y)\n\n주의할 점은 상수항 𝐶(𝑦)가 𝑦의 함수일 수 있다는 점이다. 𝐶(𝑦)는 𝑥없이 𝑦만으로 이루어진 함수를 뜻한다. 𝑦만의 함수는 𝑥로 편미분하면 0이 되기 때문이다. 물론 반드시 𝑦의 함수이어야 하는 것은 아니고 단순한 숫자 상수일 수도 있다.\n다차 도함수와 다중적분\n미분을 여러번 한 결과로 나온 다차 도함수로부터 원래의 함수를 찾아내려면 여러번 적분을 하는 다중적분(multiple intergration)이 필요하다. \n예를 들어 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)가 함수 𝐹_3(𝑥,𝑦)를 𝑥로 한번 편미분한 후 𝑦로 다시 편미분하여 나온 이차 도함수라고 하자.\n  이 이차 도함수에서 원래의 함수를 찾으려면 𝑦로 적분한 후 다시 𝑥로 적분해야 한다. 식으로는 다음처럼 나타낸다.\n\n\\dfrac{\\partial^2 F_3(x,y)}{\\partial x \\partial y}

hfun)\n\na, b은 x의 하한(lower bound)과 상한(upper bound)이고 gfun, hfun은 y의 하한과 상한이다. gfun, hfun은 x의 함수이어야 한다.\n예를 들어 다음 정적분을 계산하려면,  \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int_1^{\\infty} \\dfrac{\\exp(-xy)}{y^2} dx dy\ndef

그리드 서치(grid search) 방법이다.\n함수 𝑓_1(𝑥)의 그래프를 그려 최저점을 찾은 방법도 그리드 서치 방법의 일종이다. 그리드 서치는 가장 간단한 방법이지만 많은 𝑥 위치에 대해 목적함수 값을 계산해야 한다.\n예측 모형을 만들 때 목적함수 값, 즉 예측 오차를 구하려면 모든 트레이닝 데이터 집합에 대해 예측 값과 타겟 값의 차이를 구해야 하므로 상당히 많은 계산량을 요구한다.따라서 그리드 서치보다 목적함수 계산을 적게 할 수 있는 방법이 필요하다.\n반복적 시행 착오(trial and error)에 의해 최적화 필요조건을 만족하는 값 𝑥^∗를 찾는 방법을 수치적 최적화(numerical optimization)라고 한다. 수치적 최적화 방법은 함수 위치가 최적점이 될 때까지 가능한 한 적은

필요조건을 이용하여 최적점에 도달하였는지 판단한다.\n기울기가 0이어도 최소점이 아니라 최고점일 수도 있다. 기울기가 0인 위치가 최소점임을 확인하기 위해서는 2차 도함수의 부호도 계산해야 한다. 기울기가 0이고 2차도함수가 양수이면 최소점이다. 반대로 기울기가 0이고 2차 도함수가 음수이면 최대점이 된다.\n최급강하법(SGD)\n최급강하법(SGD;

1차원 목적함수(f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 2)를 최급강하법으로 최적화하면 다음과 같다. 우선 사람이 직접 목적함수를 미분하여 도함수를 파이썬으로 구현해야 한다. \n  def f1d(x):\n      \"\"\"derivative of f1(x)\"\"\"\n      return 2 * (x - 2.0)\n\n\nx = 0 에서 시작하여 SGD로 최적점을 찾아나가는 과정은 아래와 같다. \nSGD에서는 스텝사이즈의 크기를 적절히 조정하는 것이 중요하다.\n\n\n\n2차원 Rosenbrock 함수에 대해 SGD를 적용해보자. 목적함수를 미분하여 도함수를 구한 다음 그레디언트 벡터를 파이썬 함수로 구현하였다.  f(x, y) = (1 − x )^2 + 100(y − x^2)^2 \ndef f2g(x, y):\n\"\"\"gradient of f2(x, y)\"\"\"\nreturn np.array((2.0 * (x - 1) - 400.0 * x * (y - x**2), 200.0 * (y - x**2)))\n\n다음 그림에 𝑥=−1,𝑦−1에서 시작하여 SGD로 최적점을 찾아나가는 과정을 그레디언트 벡터 화살표와 함께 보였다.\n\n다음 그림에서 볼 수 있듯이 SGD 방법은 곡면의 모양이 계곡(valley)과 같이 생긴 경우, 즉 그레디언트 벡터가 최저점을 가리키고 있지 않는 경우에는 진동(oscillation) 현상이 발생한다. 따라서 수렴하는데 시간이 오래 걸릴 수 있다.\n\n이러한 진동 현상을 없앨 수 있는 방법으로는 2차 도함수, 즉 헤시안 행렬을 이용하는 방법이나 모멘텀 방법(momentum)이 있다. 일반적인 경우에는 2차 도함수를 이용하는 방법을 사용하고 2차 도함수를 계산하기 어려운 인공신경망 등에서는 모멘텀 방법을 선호한다.\nNormal Equation\nGradient Descent는 경사면을 하강하면서 최저점을 찾는 방식이기에 한걸음씩 내려오면서 여러번을 수행하게 된다.\nNormal Equationd은 반복없이 \\theta 를 바로 구하는 방법이다. 반복이 없기에 그만큼 빠르고 \\alpha 를 찾을 필요가 없다.\n\n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n\n2차 도함수를 사용한 Newton 방법\nNewton 방법 은 목적함수가 2차 함수라는 가정하에 한번에 최저점을 찾는 방법이다.\n그레디언트 벡터에 헤시안 행렬의 역행렬을 곱해서 방향과 거리가 변형된 그레디언트 벡터를 사용한다. \n\n{x}_{n+1} = {x}_n - [{H}f({x}_n)]^{-1} \\nabla f({x}_n)\n\n예를 들어 다음 단변수 2차 함수 f(x) = a(x-x_0)^2 + c = ax^2 -2ax_0x + x_0^2+c  는 x = x_0 에서 최소값을 가진다. \n단변수함수 Newton 방법은 다음과 같다. 즉 최적의 스텝사이즈가 \\frac{1}{f''(x_n)}이라는 것을 보여준다.\n\n{x}_{n+1} = {x}_n - \\dfrac{f'(x_n)}{f''(x_n)}\n\n{f'(x_n)} 는 그레디언트벡터, {f''(x_n)} 는 헤시안행렬\n2차 함수에 대해 도함수와 2차 도함수는 아래와 같다.\n\nf'(x) = 2ax - 2ax_0 \\\\\nf''(x) = 2a\n\nNewton 방법에 적용하면 어떤 점 x_n 에서 시작해도 바로 최저점으로 이동한다. \n\n{x}_{n+1} = {x}_n - \\dfrac{2ax_n - 2ax_0}{2a} = x_n - (x_n - x_0) = x_0\n\nQuasi_Newton 방법\nNewton 방법은 목적함수가 2차 함수와 비슷한 모양을 가진 경우에 빠르게 수렴할 수 있다는 장점이 있지만 2차도함수인 헤시안 행렬 함수를 사람이 미리 구현해 주어야 하고 함수의 모양에 따라서는 잘 수렴하지 않을 수도 있다. Quasi-Newton 방법에서는 사람이 구한 헤시안 행렬 함수를 사용하는 대신 현재 시도하고 있는 𝑥_𝑛 주변의 몇몇 점에서 함수의 값을 구하고 이를 이용하여 2차 도함수의 근사값 혹은 이에 상응하는 정보를 수치적으로 계산한다. 실제로는 BFGS(Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) 방법이 많이 사용된다.\nCG(conjugated gradient) 방법은 Quasi-Newton 방법처럼 헤시안 행렬을 필요로 하지 않고 변형된 그레디언트 벡터를 바로 계산한다.\nSciPy를 이용한 최적화\nSciPy의 optimize 서브 패키지는 최적화 명령 minimize를 제공한다. 세부적인 알고리즘은 method 인수로 선택할 수 있다. 디폴트 알고리즘은 앞에서 설명한 BFGS 방법이다. minimize 명령은 최적화하고자 하는 함수와 최적화를 시작할 초기값을 인수로 받는다. 보다 자세한 내용은 SciPy 문서를 참조한다. \nresult = minimize(func, x0, jac=jac)\n\nfunc: 목적함수\nx0: 초기값 벡터\njac: (옵션) 그레디언트 벡터를 출력하는 함수\nminimize 명령의 결과는 OptimizeResult 클래스 객체로 다음 속성을 가진다.\n\nx: 최적화 해\nsuccess: 최적화에 성공하면 True를 반환\nstatus: 종료 상태. 최적화에 성공하면 0을 반환\nmessage: 메세지 문자열\nfun: x 위치에서의 함수의 값\njac: x 위치에서의 자코비안(그레디언트) 벡터의 값\nhess_inv: x 위치에서의 헤시안 행렬의 역행렬의 값\nnfev: 목적함수 호출 횟수\nnjev: 자코비안 계산 횟수\nnhev: 헤시안 계산 횟수\nnit: x 이동 횟수\n함수 호출 계산량을 줄이기 위해서는 사람이 직접 그레디언트 벡터 값을 반환하는 함수를 만들어 jac 인수로 넣어주면 된다.\n다변수 함수를 최적화하는 경우에는 목적함수가 벡터 인수를 가져야 한다.\n\n전역 최적화 문제\n만약 최적화하려는 함수가 복수의 국소 최저점(local minima)을 가지고 있는 경우에는 수치적 최적화 방법으로 전역 최저점(global minimum)에 도달한다는 보장이 없다. 결과는 초기 추정값 및 알고리즘, 파라미터 등에 의존한다.\n\n\n컨벡스 문제\n목적함수의 2차 도함수의 값이 항상 0 이상이 되는 영역에서만 정의된 최적화 문제를 컨벡스(convex) 문제라고 한다.\n\n\\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} \\geq 0\n\n다변수 목적함수의 경우에는 주어진 영역에서 헤시안 행렬이 항상 양의 준정부호(positive semidefinite)이라는 조건이 된다.\n\nx^THx \\geq 0 \\;\\;\\text{for all } x\n\nconvex 문제에서는 유일한 전역 최저점이 존재한다.\n"},"posts/datascience/basicmath/0502constrained-optimization.html":{"url":"posts/datascience/basicmath/0502constrained-optimization.html","title":"제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제","keywords":"","body":" MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제\n\n\n\nSummary\n등식 제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제\n라그랑주 승수법\nScipy를 사용하여 등식 제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제 계산하기\n라그랑주 승수의 의미\n부등식(inequality) 제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제\n\n\nSciPy를 사용하여 부등식 제한조건이 있는 최적화 문제 계산하기\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n라그랑주 승수 방법은 원래의 목적함수 f(x) 를 사용하지 않고 제한조건 등식에 \\lambda 라는 새로운 변수를 곱해서 더한 함수를 목적함수로 간주하여 최적화한다. \n\nKKT(Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) 조건\n\n모든 독립 변수 x_1, x_2, \\ldots , x_N 에 대한 미분값이 0이다.
